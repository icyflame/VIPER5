              VIPER to VIPER 5.0 </h1>
          
          <p> 
          <pre>
              
              If you have any version before VIPER 4(1,2,3),
              Then go to the instructions that I released,
              at:
              
              <a class="btn btn-primary btn-large" href="http://siddharthkannan.webs.com/apps/blog/show/26462435-updating-from-viper-3-to-viper-4-x-executable"> Port from VIPER 3 to VIPER 4.x </a>
          </pre>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          <pre>
              If you are already running VIPER 4.1 or VIPER 4,
              
              Then all you need to do is that once you download the zip archive,
              copy the file called "viper" from the earlier folder to the folder
              where the new executable viper5.exe is there. And now run the
              viper5.exe for the first time. And you are  ready to go.
              The default master key is 'abcd'. I strongly recommend
              that you change it as soon as you run the application for the
              first time.
         
              You may delete the previous version's folder. Once you have started
              running VIPER5. But before doing so do check if all the records
              are there, by pressing the second button.
