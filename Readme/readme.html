                  VIPER is a password manager. It will keep all your passwords and
                  online account information safe. And also give you a nice GUI, to
                  retrieve this information as and when you may need it. This version
                  of VIPER is written using Python 2.7, along with the Tkinter 8.5
                  library for creating the main-menu and sub-menus in the GUI.
                  
                  The main menu is where you get access to everything that is stored
                  and also start storing new records. A record is the collection of
                  data for an account. Each reacord consists of four components.
                  
         
                  
                  1. Username
                  2. Account name
                  3. Password
                  4. Remarks
              
                  You can modify any one of these fields at any point in time once
                  you stored it in the file.
                  
                  
                  You can also delete an account altogether. But please note that
                  this will remove the record from the memory and there is no
                  way whatsoever to get this back. i.e. this change is irreversible.
                  
                  You can delete all the accounts altogether. Though you may never need 
                  this option in case you do, You can use it. This option too is irreversible
                  and can't be changed.
                  
                  You can check the number of records that are stored in the file. This 
                  option does not require the master password.
                  
                  Once you press the quit button then you will be greeted with a credits
                  screen. This screen will be there for 8 seconds and then the appliation
                  will be automatically terminated. You can quit the application in between
                  this 8 second interval by pressing the close window button that is there at 
                  the top right corner.
