                There were many changes that  I wanted to introduce in 
                the fifth version. The major of which was encryption for
                the data. Other than that too some other features like 
                multiple windows for more number of records. I was able to 
                introduce only the latter in the latest version, 4.1. The former
                will be implemented in this version. 
 
                The major reason that I am including encryption for data
                is that, at present, the data is stored as a text file. 

                While reading this on a windows machine may prove to be 
                harder than normal,on a Linux machine this becomes very simple. 
                The file is automatically opened in a text editor. And 
                all the data is compromised. Though I tried to introduce
                this before too, I did not have the right platform. But now I have cracked it. 

                I strongly recommend that all of you shift to VIPER 5
                immediately.
